# Observer Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Observer design pattern. The Observer pattern is used to allow an object, known as the `Subject`, to notify a list of dependents, known as `Observers`, about any state changes. This is typically done by calling one of the observer's methods.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **WeatherData**: This class is the subject that maintains the state and notifies the observers about changes in weather data.
2. **Observer**: An interface for objects that want to be notified of changes in the `WeatherData`.
3. **CurrentConditionsDisplay**: An implementation of the `Observer` interface that displays current weather conditions.
4. **StatisticsDisplay**: An implementation of the `Observer` interface that displays weather statistics.
5. **ForecastDisplay**: An implementation of the `Observer` interface that displays weather forecasts.
6. **WeatherStation**: The main class to initialize the subject and observers and simulate changes in weather data.

### Files

- **WeatherData.java**: Implements the subject with methods to register, remove, and notify observers.
- **Observer.java**: Interface for observers which should be notified of changes in the subject.
- **CurrentConditionsDisplay.java**: Concrete implementation of the `Observer` that displays the current weather conditions.
- **StatisticsDisplay.java**: Concrete implementation of the `Observer` that displays statistical information about the weather.
- **ForecastDisplay.java**: Concrete implementation of the `Observer` that provides weather forecasts.
- **WeatherStation.java**: Main class to set up the `WeatherData` subject and add different observers to it.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `observer` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Main Class**

   ```bash
   java WeatherStation
   ```
This `README.md` provides an overview of the Observer pattern implementation, including the components involved, how to run the example, and the expected output.
