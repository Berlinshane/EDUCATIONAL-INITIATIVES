# Strategy Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Strategy design pattern. The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **Duck**: An abstract class defining the common interface for ducks. It utilizes strategies for flying and quacking behaviors.
2. **MallardDuck**: A concrete class that extends `Duck` and uses specific behaviors for flying and quacking.
3. **ModelDuck**: Another concrete class that extends `Duck` and uses different behaviors compared to `MallardDuck`.
4. **FlyBehavior**: An interface for different flying behaviors.
5. **QuackBehavior**: An interface for different quacking behaviors.
6. **FlyWithWings**: A concrete implementation of `FlyBehavior` for flying with wings.
7. **FlyNoWay**: A concrete implementation of `FlyBehavior` for ducks that cannot fly.
8. **Quack**: A concrete implementation of `QuackBehavior` for quacking.
9. **MuteQuack**: A concrete implementation of `QuackBehavior` for silent quacking.
10. **Main**: The main class to run the example and demonstrate different strategies.

### Files

- **Duck.java**: Abstract class that defines the `Duck` interface and sets up behavior strategies.
- **MallardDuck.java**: Concrete `Duck` class that implements specific flying and quacking behaviors.
- **ModelDuck.java**: Another concrete `Duck` class with different behavior implementations.
- **FlyBehavior.java**: Interface for various flying behaviors.
- **QuackBehavior.java**: Interface for various quacking behaviors.
- **FlyWithWings.java**: Implementation of `FlyBehavior` for flying with wings.
- **FlyNoWay.java**: Implementation of `FlyBehavior` for ducks that cannot fly.
- **Quack.java**: Implementation of `QuackBehavior` for quacking.
- **MuteQuack.java**: Implementation of `QuackBehavior` for silent quacking.
- **Main.java**: Main class to initialize and demonstrate the Strategy pattern.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `strategy` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Main Class**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
This `README.md` provides an overview of the Strategy pattern implementation, including the key components, how to run the example, and the expected output.
