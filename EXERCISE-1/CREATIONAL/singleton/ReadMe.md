Here is the `README.md` file specifically for the Singleton pattern example:

```markdown
# Singleton Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when exactly one instance of a class is needed to control actions, such as configuration management.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **ConfigurationManager**: The Singleton class that manages configuration settings. It ensures that only one instance of this class is created and provides a global access point to it.
2. **Main**: The main class to demonstrate the Singleton pattern by accessing the single instance of `ConfigurationManager`.

### Files

- **ConfigurationManager.java**: Implements the Singleton pattern. It contains a private static instance and a private constructor to prevent external instantiation. The static method `getInstance()` provides access to the single instance.
- **Main.java**: Main class to demonstrate the use of the `ConfigurationManager` Singleton and show how to access the single instance.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `singleton` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Main Class**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
This `README.md` provides a detailed overview of the Singleton pattern implementation, including the components, how to run the example, and the expected output.
