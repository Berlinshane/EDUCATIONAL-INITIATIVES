# Adapter Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Adapter design pattern, which allows incompatible interfaces to work together. The Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects, enabling classes with incompatible interfaces to interact.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **MediaPlayer**: An interface that defines the media player functionality.
2. **AdvancedMediaPlayer**: An interface for playing advanced media formats.
3. **VlcPlayer**: A concrete class that implements `AdvancedMediaPlayer` to play VLC files.
4. **Mp4Player**: A concrete class that implements `AdvancedMediaPlayer` to play MP4 files.
5. **MediaAdapter**: An adapter class that implements `MediaPlayer` and uses `AdvancedMediaPlayer` to play different types of media files.
6. **AudioPlayer**: A concrete class that implements `MediaPlayer` and uses `MediaAdapter` to play media files.
7. **Main**: The main class to demonstrate the use of the Adapter pattern by playing different media files.

### Files

- **MediaPlayer.java**: Interface defining methods for playing media files.
- **AdvancedMediaPlayer.java**: Interface for playing advanced media formats.
- **VlcPlayer.java**: Concrete implementation of `AdvancedMediaPlayer` for VLC files.
- **Mp4Player.java**: Concrete implementation of `AdvancedMediaPlayer` for MP4 files.
- **MediaAdapter.java**: Adapter class that converts `AdvancedMediaPlayer` to `MediaPlayer` interface.
- **AudioPlayer.java**: Implements `MediaPlayer` and uses `MediaAdapter` to play various media formats.
- **Main.java**: Demonstrates how the `AudioPlayer` class uses the `MediaAdapter` to play different types of media files.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `adapter` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Main Class**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
This `README.md` provides a clear overview of the Adapter pattern implementation, including the components involved, how to run the example, and the expected output based on your provided results.
