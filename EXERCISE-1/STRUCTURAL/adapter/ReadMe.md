# Adapter Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Adapter design pattern. The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **Target**: An interface that defines the domain-specific interface that the client expects.
2. **Adaptee**: An existing class with an interface that is incompatible with the `Target` interface.
3. **Adapter**: A class that implements the `Target` interface and adapts the `Adaptee` interface to it.
4. **Client**: The class that uses the `Target` interface.

### Files

- **Target.java**: Interface that defines the expected domain-specific interface.
- **Adaptee.java**: Existing class with an incompatible interface.
- **Adapter.java**: Implements the `Target` interface and adapts the `Adaptee` interface.
- **Client.java**: Uses the `Target` interface, demonstrating how the adapter works.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `adapter` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Client Class**

   ```bash
   java Client
   ```
This `README.md` provides an overview of the Adapter pattern implementation, including the components involved, how to run the example, and the expected output.
