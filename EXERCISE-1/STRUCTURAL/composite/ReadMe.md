# Composite Pattern Example

This project demonstrates the Composite design pattern. The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Project Overview

### Components

1. **Employee**: A class that represents both leaf and composite objects in the hierarchy. It contains attributes like name, department, and salary.
2. **CompositeEmployee**: A concrete class that extends `Employee` and can contain other `Employee` objects, representing composite nodes in the hierarchy.
3. **Main**: The main class that demonstrates the use of the Composite pattern by creating and displaying a hierarchical structure of employees.

### Files

- **Employee.java**: Defines the common interface for both leaf and composite objects in the hierarchy. Includes methods for displaying employee details.
- **CompositeEmployee.java**: A concrete class that extends `Employee` and manages a collection of `Employee` objects, representing composite nodes.
- **Main.java**: Demonstrates how to create and manage a hierarchy of `Employee` objects using `CompositeEmployee`, and displays the employee details.

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to the `composite` Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <dir>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. **Run the Main Class**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
This `README.md` file provides an overview of the Composite pattern implementation, including the key components, how to run the example, and the expected output.
