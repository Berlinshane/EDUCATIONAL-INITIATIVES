Here's a `README.md` file specifically for the Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer project:

# Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer

This repository contains a console-based Java application designed to help astronauts organize their daily schedules. The application allows users to manage tasks with details such as description, start time, end time, and priority level. It demonstrates the use of various design patterns and coding best practices.

## Features

- **Add a new task** with description, start time, end time, and priority level.
- **Remove an existing task**.
- **View all tasks** sorted by start time.
- **Validate tasks** to ensure they do not overlap with existing tasks.
- **Edit tasks** (optional).
- **Mark tasks as completed** (optional).
- **View tasks by priority level** (optional).

## Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of the `ScheduleManager` class manages all tasks.
- **Factory Pattern**: Uses a `TaskFactory` class to create `Task` objects.
- **Observer Pattern**: Notifies users if a new task conflicts with existing tasks.

Error Handling
The application gracefully handles exceptions and provides appropriate error messages for invalid operations, such as overlapping tasks or invalid input.

Logging
The application includes a logging mechanism to track usage and errors, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.
